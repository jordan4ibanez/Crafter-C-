# Crafter
This is Crafter, I'm not sure if I'll finish it. I'm mainly just transitioning from LWJGL to C++ and OpenGL libraries with OpenAL.

This is going to be pretty messy for a bit.

Trying something new. Like each folder in /src/ is a "package", with the main initializer main.cpp being in the root directory. Might change it, not sure.
