# Crafter
This is Crafter, I'm not sure if I'll finish it. I'm mainly just transitioning from LWJGL to C++ and OpenGL libraries with OpenAL.

I am learning C++ while making this project, if you know C++ and see something you feel the need to tell me is wrong: https://discord.gg/mtXkQRT7Cx

This is going to be pretty messy for a bit.

Trying something new. Like each folder in /src/ is a "package", with the main initializer main.cpp being in the root directory. Might change it, not sure.

Notes on required Linux Mint 20.2 packages (this is probably the same in all Debian based distros, maybe):

    $ gcc cmake build-essential libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
